<span style="color:red">I am on job market and am actively seeking Research Scientist/Research Internship positions. If you are interested in my profile, please feel free to contact me via email at thanhtul[at]uci[dot]edu or [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thanh-tung-le-741668170/).</span>

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, advised by Professor [Xiaohui Xie](https://uci-xie-lab.github.io/). My research focuses on **Generative Models** and **3D Vision**, with a broader interest in developing robust **Multimodal AI systems**. I aim to create general-purpose **World Models** that can learn from rich visual data, enabling interactive and dynamic environments.

<!-- I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Computer Science, University of California Irvine (UCI) advised by Professor [Xiaohui Xie](https://uci-xie-lab.github.io/). My research interests are in Generative models and 3D. I am also interested in building multimodal AI systems that are robust. My goal is to build general purpose world models, in which AI systems learn from rich visual information, enabling interactive enviroments.

Currently, I am working on various computer vision, especially **3D vision**, and deep generative for 3D problems. Recently, I've spent a wonderful internship (Summer'24) at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), working on neural rendering and polarization. -->

Research interests:

1. Generative models
- Diffusion Models, Flow Matching, Autoregressive, Masked Autoregressive Models, Hybrid Generative Approaches.
- Video Generation, Diffusion Distillation, Generative Novel Views Synthesis, Diffusion-based Dense Estimation. 

2. 3D vision
- Novel View Synthesis, 3D Shape Analysis and Representations, Neural Rendering (NeRF and 3DGS-based).
- 2.5D Scene Representation: Depth/Normals Estimation.
- Efficient Optimal Transport for 3D Shape Learning.

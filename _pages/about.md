I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science, University of California Irvine (UCI) advised by Professor [Xiaohui Xie](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~xhx/). Currently, I am working on various computer vision, especially **3D vision**, and deep learning problems. Recently, I've spent a wonderful internship (Summer'24) at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), working on neural rendering and polarization.

Research interests:
- 3D shape analysis/representations.
- Neural/inverse rendering. 
- Deep generative models.
- 2.5D scene representation: Depth/Normals estimation.
- Efficient optimal transport.
- Medical imaging (I switched to general vision shortly after joining PhD). 

Feel free to check out other related work from our talented lab's colleagues at [Xie Lab](https://uci-xie-lab.github.io/). 
<!-- My research interests are in Deep Learning and Computer Vision focusing on 3D Vision. My goal is to allow neural nets to reason and understand our 3D world given visual observations, e.g. images and videos, and textual information.
